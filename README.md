## Military Power Visualization Application for Countries Worldwide (1960-2024)
This is a very interesting project idea for military fan! Creating a visualization application that displays changes in military power of countries worldwide from 1960 to 2024 perfectly meets your project requirements. Below are some specific suggestions:

## Data Sources
You can consider the following public data sources:

- Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) - provides military expenditure data
- Global Firepower Index - provides comprehensive military power rankings
- World Bank Open Data - provides related economic and population data
- Our World in Data - provides historical military data
- Uppsala Conflict Data Program - provides conflict data

## Visualization Solutions
1. Interactive World Map:
   
   - Use color depth to represent military strength
   - Click on countries to display detailed information

2. Timeline Slider:
   
   - Drag the slider to see changes in global military landscape across different years
   - Add a play button to automatically display animations of changes over time

3. Multi-dimensional Comparison Charts:
   
   - Bar charts comparing military expenditure of different countries
   - Radar charts comparing different dimensions of military power (army, navy, air force, etc.)
   - Line charts showing trends in military power over time
